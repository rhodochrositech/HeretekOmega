Unlike the plasteel and ceramite of normal power armour, the artefact is made from plates of raw adamantine, making it all but unbreachable by conventional weaponry. When rained upon with heavier fire, the Armour lndomitus manifests a shimmering force field, the secrets of which have long been lost to modern artificers.|
000001629|The Shield Eternal|Chapter Relics|Model with a storm shield, <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/space-marines/#Relic-shield">relic shield</a> or combat shield only.

This magnificently worked storm shield is a bulwark against which all the wrath of a hateful galaxy can crash. Its warding powers turn aside the maleficent attentions of the witch and the daemon, safeguarding its wearer from mortal blows and perfidious warpcraft alike.|
000001630|Teeth of Terra|Chapter Relics|Model equipped with an Astartes chainsword only. This Relic replaces an Astartes chainsword and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The origins of the Teeth of Terra lie shrouded in mystery. Mentions of this large, obsidian-toothed chainsword can be found dotted throughout the histories of many Space Marine Chapters, yet the weapon itself can be traced to no artisans hand, nor can it be found in any Chapter’s Armoury save in times of the greatest need. What is certain is that, when wielded in battle by a true hero of the Imperium, the Teeth of Terra strikes with the force of a thunderbolt, leaving a bloody trail of broken bodies in its wake.|

It is said that its constant proximity to the Master of Mankind has imbued within it indelible traces of his psychic signature. Whatever the truth of this, its presence is a constant inspiration to those loyal to the Emperors cause, instilling them with valour and determination even as their foes quail in its presence.|
000001632|Primarch’s Wrath|Chapter Relics|Model equipped with a boltgun, master-crafted boltgun or special issue bolt carbine only. This Relic replaces a boltgun, master-crafted boltgun or special issue bolt carbine and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The ancient boltgun known as the Primarch’s Wrath is believed to have come from the personal weapons collection of Roboute Guilliman himself. Perhaps the finest example of its kind ever crafted, it has dispensed thunderous death to the foes of Mankind for millennia. Chased in Theldrite moonsilver and inscribed in microscopic lettering with every treatise on tactics that Guilliman ever penned, this weapon’s quality is such that it allows its wielder to sweep away great swathes of the enemy with a storm of armour-piercing, fragmenting bolts.|
000001633|The Burning Blade|Chapter Relics|Model equipped with a power sword or master-crafted power sword only. This Relic replaces a power sword or master-crafted power sword, and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This ancient broadsword is so large and dense that no mere Human could lift it, let alone wield it in battle. It was recovered from the wreckage of Horus’ battle barge, the only unblemished artefact in a chamber crawling with the filthy taint of Chaos. Some artificers have posited that it is the Master of Mankind’s greatness that shines out from its sacred steel. In the heat of battle, the sword blazes so brightly that it can melt through even the thickest armour.|

The bearer knows one additional psychic power from any discipline it has access to.||true|SM|Space Marines|Malcador the Sigillite was the trusted aide of the Emperor himself. The most potent Human psyker of the time, the tome he penned on the nature of reality enhances the mind of the reader.|
000001635|The Salamander’s Mantle|Relics of Nocturne|When resolving an attack made against a model with this Relic, subtract 1 from the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|This heavy-scaled mantle is made from the dense hide of one of Nocturne’s massive salamander lizards, which live in the deepest lava flows of the planet’s volcanoes. In battle, this cloak can turn blades and bolts aside in a shower of flame, mimicking the durability of the fire-breathing beast it was made from.|
000001636|The Axe of Medusa|Relics of Medusa|Model equipped with a power axe only. This Relic replaces a power axe and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The Axe of Medusa, said to have been forged by Manus’ own hand, is held by the Iron Council and given to the Chapter’s chosen war leader as a badge of office. For over three centuries this weapon has been wielded by Kardan Stronos, but when dispatching another champion of the Iron Hands on a vital mission, Stronos has been known to bestow it as a mark of favour and faith.|
000001637|Raven’s Fury|Relics of Ravenspire|<span class="tooltip00538" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00538" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00538"><span class="kwb">JUMP</span> <span class="kwb">PACK</span></span> model only.

When a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit">charge roll</a> is made for that model, you can re-roll the dice. In addition, after that model finishes a charge move, you can select one enemy unit within 1" of that model and roll one D6; on a 4+ that enemy unit suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|At first glance, this jump pack appears little different to any other in the Raven Guard armoury. However, closer inspection reveals it to be a technological marvel, now well beyond the skills of the Imperium’s finest artificers. With miniaturised plasma-engines in place of traditional ram jets, the Raven’s Fury provides its wearer with a lightning turn of speed when boosting into battle.|
000001638|Mantle of the Stormseer|Relics of Chogoris|<span class="tooltip00539" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00539" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00539"><span class="kwb">PSYKER</span></span> model only.

None know who crafted this relic, but it is gifted to whichever White Scars Librarian demonstrates the greatest skill in the Arts of Heaven. Said to channel spirits of the tempest, the mantle allows the wearer to wield the wrath of the storm itself. At such times, the Stormseer’s eyes glow with a harsh light and his voice is that of a raging hurricane.|
000001639|Fist of Vengeance|Relics of the Fists|<span class="kwb">CRIMSON</span> <span class="kwb">FISTS</span> model with a power fist only. This Relic replaces a power fist and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This master-crafted power fist is blood red, and chipped and marked with hundreds of battle scars. Forged many years before the cataclysm that almost destroyed the Crimson Fists, the Fist of Vengeance was recovered from the ruins of the Chapter’s fortress monastery. In the years since that dark day, this symbol of resilience and defiance has been borne into battle by many heroes of the Chapter.|

Worked into its ancient vox-piece is the jawbone of Saint Sebatus the Ancient, a sanctified relic that emboldens the voice of the wearer so that his oratory soars above the clash of battle. The hearts of nearby battle-brothers are filled with zealous fire, and none can stand before their fury.|
000001642|The Spartean|Relics of the Fists|<span class="kwb">IMPERIAL</span> <span class="kwb">FISTS</span> model with a bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol only. This Relic replaces a bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This bolt pistol is a true work of the artificer’s art. Since its forging in M35, hundreds of warriors have used the pistol to myriad enemies of Mankind. All of its bearers have remarked upon the weapon’s potent and noble machine spirit, a presence so manifest that it felt as though the weapon was a battle-brother stood always at their side.|

000001685|The Black Mace|Relics of Chaos|Model with power maul, accursed crozius or accursed weapon only. This Relic replaces a power maul, accursed crozius or accursed weapon and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This malefic mace is said to have been cursed by each of the Daemon Primarchs.

This Relic replaces a storm bolter or master-crafted storm bolter and has the following profile:||true|GK|Grey Knights|When the moon of Deimos was gifted to Titan by the Adeptus Mechanicus, it carried with it a ship loaded with some of the finest weapons the Imperium has ever created. Among them was the Fury of Deimos, a weapon crafted by the first Fabricator General of Mars in the aftermath of the Horus Heresy. Superior in accuracy, rate of fire and reliability to a lesser storm bolter, it is a relic whose secrets have long been forgotten.|

000001697|Soul Glaive|Relics of Titan|Model equipped with a Nemesis force halberd only. This Relic replaces a Nemesis force halberd and has the following profile:||true|GK|Grey Knights|Over centuries of war, a fraction of a Grey Knight’s essence may imprint itself upon his weapon. In rare cases, this imprint is so strong that it persists after death, and another can wield the blade to combine their own psychic might with that of a fallen hero. The Soul Glaive is such a weapon, a halberd that was carried into battle by the 13th Supreme Grand Master of the Grey Knights, Lord Sylas Kalthorn, who defeated the Daemon Prince Ka laedzar in single combat.|

Very much a weapon of last resort, this small pendant pulses when activated, resonating at such a frequency that its vibrations echo through all realms, including the warp. For reasons unknown, this regular thrum boosts the growth and vitality of wraithbone - but such vigour comes at a cost. After such an unprecedented burst of energy, the wraithbone becomes brittle, often cracking open.|

This Relic replaces 2 monstrous scything talons and has the following profile:||true|TYR|Tyranids|The few remaining records of the fall of Tyran Primus speak of an alpha-beast that led the assault upon Magos Varnaks command bunker, tearing open the facility’s vast bulkhead doors with a single slash of its scything forelimbs. So sharp were these monomolecular-edged weapon-growths that several Skitarii defenders were bisected with the alpha-beast’s every frenzied swipe. The vicious blade-limbs of this appalling biohorror have since been witnessed several times by observers battling many different hive fleets across the galaxy.|

When surgically implanted into the brain of a Fire Caste Commander, the bearer can access much of the wisdom of Puretide himself, drawing upon a great reservoir of tactical acumen.|

Each time a Reanimation Protocol roll is made for those reanimation protocols, add 1 to the result.||true|NEC|Necrons|The Orb of Eternity is thought to be the first resurrection orb ever created. For millennia, it rested in a primitive fane on the world of Ormandus, where the indigenous populace marvelled at its ability to effect repairs upon their technologies. Ever since this state of affairs was righted by a host of Triarch Praetorians, the orb has been imparted as a boon to those nobles who are deemed worthy.|
000002001|Voidreaper|Relics of the Aeons|Model with warscythe or voidscythe only. Voidreaper replaces the bearer’s warscythe or voidscythe and has the following profile:||true|NEC|Necrons|Legend has it that on the day the Nightbringer was sundered into shards, this warscythe appeared in the armoury of the Nekthyst Dynasty’s crownworld. Its blade is a sliver of the void, and when swung, it cuts through more than just mere physical forms. Its victims drop to the ground as husks, their souls torn from their bodies before dissipating with final screams of horror.|
000002004|Gauntlet of the Conflagrator|Relics of the Aeons|The Relic has the following profile:||true|NEC|Necrons|Crafted by the Cryptek Harriapt the Conflagrator, this gauntlet uses interdimensional energy-exchangers to open a microscopic conduit to the raging heart of a star. The superheated plasmic flame that erupts through this hole is forced down a cone of hyper-dense gravitons that spew the energy forth in a blazing cloud.|

If two units are set back up on the battlefield using this Relic, both units must be placed wholly within 6" of each other.||true|NEC|Necrons|This device was fashioned from transpositanium, a substance so rare that it can only be found in a handful of places in the galaxy. It is highly sought after by the Necrons, and wars have been waged to secure it. Activated with a thought, the veil causes space and time to warp around its user and those near them, enfolding them in a swirling darkness. As the darkness fades, the user and their comrades appear elsewhere on the battlefield, transported through a miracle of arcane science.|

Add 1 to the Toughness and Wounds characteristics of the bearer.||true|NEC|Necrons|Only the finest Cryptek artificers know the secret of crafting a Sempiternal Weave. These gossamer-thin plates are formed from phase-hardened amarathine and threads of adamantine. They are then layered over the bearers carapace of living metal, stiffening and contracting when struck to turn aside energy blades, bolt shells and even the searing heat of a plasma burst.|
000002010|Voltaic Staff|Relics of the Aeons|Model with a staff of light only. This Relic replaces a staff of light and has the following profile:||true|NEC|Necrons|The Voltaic Staff is the pinnacle of the art of aethermancy. Blazing arcs of lightning continuously ripple down the shaft of this onyx stave, and the bearer can send these electrostatic beams hurtling towards their enemies with fearsome rapidity. Living targets are enveloped in a searing halo of bone charring voltage, while vehicles find their guidance systems burned out and their hulls peeled open.|
000002011|Blood Scythe|Relics of the Aeons|<span class="kwb">NOVOKH</span> model with a voidscythe or warscythe only. This Relic replaces a voidscythe or warscythe and has the following profile:||true|NEC|Necrons|It is said that Ultep the Divider fought ten thousand duels and was never once defeated. He is amongst the Novokh’s greatest heroes, venerated to this day by the dynasty’s warrior cults. Only the untrammelled power of a rampaging C’tan finally scattered Ultep’s metal body to atoms, though his crimson war scythe survived his destruction. Forged from sanguiphagic star-metal alloys, a single cut from this blade can draw a torrent of blood from an opponent.|

This Relic replaces a staff of light and has the following profile:||true|NEC|Necrons|Forged within the Heliaconvarium of Aryand, the Solar Staff burns with the light of truth and honour. Set loose, the staff’s energies blaze outward in a mighty flare, as though a new sun was born. The darkness is driven back by this false dawn, and the foe reels as their eyes are blinded and their deceptions are laid bare.|

This Relic replaces a splinter pistol and has the following profile:||true|DRU|Drukhari|Thought to be the finest splinter pistol ever crafted, this weapon spits out crystalline darts bound with psycho-vampiric circuitry. Upon biting into their flesh, the target’s very soul is leeched and transferred back to the gun’s wielder. As the luckless victim withers like rotten fruit, their killer flushes with vigour.|

Not only do they tempt the gaze of She Who Thirsts, but they also risk the wrath of Asdrubael Vect. Through necessity, the Drukhari’s psychic abilities have atrophied, leaving them vulnerable to the warpcraft of their foes. The Helm of Spite redresses this imbalance, shielding its wearer from harm and setting up a field of violent psionic feedback.|

Each time the bearer would lose a wound, roll one D6: on a 4+, that wound is not lost.||true|DRU|Drukhari|Should the owner of the Nightmare Doll be harmed in battle, his injuries are absorbed by this creature. If its owner is riddled with bullets, tiny holes appear in the thing’s writhing body whilst its master remains whole. Should the Haemonculus be hit by a decapitating strike, the foe’s blade will pass through his gnarled neck without leaving so much as a scratch.|
000002021|The Animus Vitae|Artefacts of Cruelty|The Animus Vitae has the following profile:||true|DRU|Drukhari|Tire Animus Vitae appears to be a smooth orb, until it is thrown at the feet of a victim and explodes into a lashing tangle of barbed wires that wrap around its prey. Slowly and spitefully, the Animus Vitae begins to constrict, cutting through armour, flesh and bone until its victims agonised cries become desperate screams. All the while the foul weapon radiates this agony, saturating the battlefield with pain so that the bearer and his kin can drink it in like a potent draught.|

000002060|Sanctuary|Heirloom Relics|<span class="tooltip00584" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00584" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00584"><span class="kwb">QUESTORIS-CLASS</span></span> or <span class="tooltip00585" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00585" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00585"><span class="kwb">ARMIGER-CLASS</span></span> model only. The bearer has a 4+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a> against melee attacks.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|Despite whispers of xenos taint in its origins, the potent ion shield generator known as Sanctuary is a venerated war relic. Through the projection of rapidly modulating and overlapping energy fields, coupled with a steady emission of warding incense and a cycling barrage of data-hymnals, this device wards away the furious fire of the enemy. It does not even require tilting and angling like a typical ion shield, for its effects wreathe the Knight suit in an all-encompassing fog of protective energies and holy wards. The resultant field clings to the Knight like an energised second skin, flexing and shifting with its movement and protecting it from close-quarters attacks.|
000002061|Ravager|Heirloom Relics|Model with a reaper chainsword only. Ravager replaces the bearers reaper chainsword and has the following profile:<br><br>Each time an attack is made with this weapon, select one of the profiles below to make that attack with. Each time an attack is made with this weapon profile, on an unmodified <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a> of 6, one additional hit is scored.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This scarred chainsword has claimed millions of lives during its service to the noble houses. Its razor-sharp teeth were harvested from the canines of a long-extinct species of bio-horror called a Balethrox. What makes this fact so startling is that dozens of the fell creatures must have been hunted down and slain by brave Knights in order to secure enough fangs to line Ravager’s blade. However, witnessing the wrath of this chainblade’s touch in battle more than justifies the dedication of those long-dead Knights, and its bearer fights all the harder to honour their sacrifice.|
000002062|The Paragon Gauntlet|Heirloom Relics|Model with a thunderstrike gauntlet only. The Paragon Gauntlet replaces the bearers thunderstrike gauntlet and has the following profile:<br><br>Each time an attack is made with this weapon, select one of the profiles below to make that attack with.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|It is believed that this masterwork weapon was the prototype for the thunderstrike gauntlet - the first, perfect copy fabricated by a long lost STC that was developed on Mars during the Age of Technology. It was that same STC that was integral to the founding of the Knight worlds themselves, by equipping Mankind’s first colonisation fleets with the knowledge to build the mighty armoured suits. If true, it would certainly explain the incredible level of artifice that went into the gauntlet’s creation.|
000002063|Armour of the Sainted Ion|Heirloom Relics|<span class="tooltip00584" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00584" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00584"><span class="kwb">QUESTORIS-CLASS</span></span> or <span class="tooltip00585" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00585" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00585"><span class="kwb">ARMIGER-CLASS</span></span> model only. The bearer has a Save characteristic of 2+.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This carapace body glove is worn by the Noble pilot. It is studded with electro-sockets that couple with the machineries of the Throne Mechanicum. Once bonded, the micro-generators within the armour thrum to life. They project streams of ionic energy, not only wreathing the pilot and their Throne in a protective shield, but reinforcing and protecting the Knight’s internal systems. Thus, even shots and blows that penetrate the outer shell of the Knight’s armour may fail to cause any harm.|
000002064|Endless Fury|Heirloom Relics|Model with an avenger gatling cannon only. Endless Fury replaces the bearers avenger gatling cannon and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This remarkable avenger gatling cannon is fitted with ballistic micro-fabricators that churn out fresh ammunition as fast as it can be fired. Rumours persist of the weapons wielders being driven slowly mad with bloodlust, but even if there is truth to these claims, it is seen as a small price to pay for the power unleashed.|
000002065|Judgement|Heirloom Relics|Model with a stormspear rocket pod only. Judgement replaces the bearer’s stormspear rocket pod and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This unique rocket pod fires self-propelled adamantine-tipped warheads fitted with servitor brains and running venatoris autotargeting protocols. Once launched, these projectiles mercilessly hunt their prey across the battlefield.|
000002067|Helm of the Nameless Warrior|Heirloom Relics|<span class="tooltip00586" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00586" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00586"><span class="kwb">QUESTOR</span> <span class="kwb">IMPERIALIS</span> <span class="kwb">QUESTORIS-CLASS</span></span> or <span class="tooltip00587" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00587" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00587"><span class="kwb">QUESTOR</span> <span class="kwb">IMPERIALS</span> <span class="kwb">ARMIGER-CLASS</span></span> models only. Each time the bearer makes a melee attack, on an unmodified <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a> of 6, that attack inflicts a number of <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a> equal to the Damage characteristic of that attack and the attack sequence ends.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|Though many great heroes through the ages have mounted this faceplate upon their Knight suits, the names of both the suit and the valiant pilot who first bore this helm have been lost to history. Regardless of its origins, the Helm of the Nameless Warrior has become synonymous with murderous ferocity in battle.|

Legend has it that the Banner of Macharius Triumphant has never seen defeat: every time a Knight has carried it to war, a great victory has been won. To see its form fluttering in the wind instils the Emperor’s warriors with a sense of honour, for to fight in its shadow is to all but assure victory.|
000002069|Traitor’s Pyre|Heirloom Relics|<span class="tooltip00590" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00590" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00590"><span class="kwb">QUESTOR</span> <span class="kwb">IMPERIALIS</span> <span class="kwb">KNIGHT</span> <span class="kwb">VALIANT</span></span> model only. Traitor’s Pyre replaces the bearer’s conflagration cannon and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This ornate conflagration cannon was borne upon a three-hundred and-fifty year pilgrimage to the cardinal world of Basphoria, so that it might be blessed by Saint Gauschwyn the Wrathful. The saint’s spiritual influence fortified the weapon’s machine spirit and greatly enhanced its ferocity, imparting a portion of Gauschwyn’s infamous wrath upon it.|
000002070|Mark of the Omnissiah|Heirloom Relics|<span class="tooltip00591" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00591" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00591"><span class="kwb">QUESTOR</span> <span class="kwb">MECHANICUS</span> <span class="kwb">QUESTORIS-CLASS</span></span> or <span class="tooltip00592" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00592" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00592"><span class="kwb">QUESTOR</span> <span class="kwb">MECHANICUS</span> <span class="kwb">ARMIGER-CLASS</span></span> model only. At the start of each of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#COMMAND-PHASE">Command phases</a>, this model is repaired and regains up to D3 lost wounds. Each model can only be repaired once per turn. Note that if this model has the <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/imperial-knights/#Questor-Mechanicus:-Sacristan-Pledge">Sacristan Pledge</a> Questor Allegiance Oath, it means at the start of each of your Command phases it will regain D3+1 wounds.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|Forged in the shape of the cog of Mars, the Mark of the Omnissiah is an incredibly potent self-repair device. If the Knight suit upon which it is affixed takes battle damage, reconstruction protocols automatically engage to repair rents and restore lost power.|
000002071|The Helm Dominatus|Heirloom Relics|<span class="tooltip00584" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00584" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00584"><span class="kwb">QUESTORIS-CLASS</span></span> model with a <span class="tooltip00593" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00593"><span class="tt kwbu">Bondsman</span> <span class="tt kwbu">ability</span></span> only.

While the bearer is on the battlefield, that ability will affect that <span class="kwb">ARMIGER-CLASS</span> model until the end of the battle (instead of until the start of your next Command phase), or until that <span class="kwb">ARMIGER-CLASS</span> model is affected by another Bondsman ability - whichever happens first.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This noospheric interface boosts the bearer’s ability to communicate with their bondsmen and enables them to emit a temporary cerebral override that beckons bonded Armigers to aid the bearer to defeat the foe.|
000002072|Cawl’s Wrath|Heirloom Relics|<span class="tooltip00594" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00594" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00594"><span class="kwb">QUESTOR</span> <span class="kwb">MECHANICUS</span> <span class="kwb">KNIGHT</span> <span class="kwb">CASTELLAN</span></span> only. Cawls Wrath replaces the bearer’s plasma decimator and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|During his centuries-long efforts to reduce the size and increase the portability of advanced plasma weaponry, Archmagos Cawl created this singular plasma decimator. Its enhanced containment fields and machine spirit data-shackles allow it to generate even more lethal volumes of energy than a typical example of such a weapon.|

It was crafted by the artificers of the Blood Angels Chapter to honour a debt to one of House Hawkshroud’s devoted Knights who fought alongside them on Theska II. Unnatural manifestations of empyric power, the malefic conjurations of damned sorcerers, and all other forms of foul witchery are warded away by the Angels Grace, lending credence to the claim that whoever sits their Throne beneath the ornate device enjoys the personal protection of the Primarch Sanguinius himself.|

Each time the bearer makes a ranged attack, the target does not receive the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-and-Cover">benefits of cover</a> against that attack.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This remarkable data-manifold was recovered by the Nobles of House Cadmus almost eight millennia ago, during a crusade amidst the blighted tech-graves of Kossok’s World. It surrounds a Nobles Throne with a remarkable holo-projected bio-scan and engine-signature read-out whose gaze penetrates the densest terrain as though it were not there. Thus, the pilot is able to direct their fury against even those enemies who believe themselves wholly safe and undetected.|
000002077|Honour’s Bite|Heirloom Relics|<span class="tooltip00599" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00599" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00599"><span class="kwb">HOUSE</span> <span class="kwb">MORTAN</span></span> model with reaper chainsword only. This Relic replaces a reaper chainsword and has the following profile:<br><br>Each time an attack is made with this weapon, select one of the profiles below to make that attack with.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|Honour’s Bite was fashioned by a conclave of tech-magi from the forge world of Ionus X. It was created as payment for the heroic sacrifice of High King Garthalomew Mortan, who stood alone in his Knight Paladin Lord of the Hunt against three enraged Squiggoths during the Dastorvol Evacuation. Garthalomew held off the trio of savage greenskin beasts, slaying the third even as it laid him low. In the process, he protected the entire tech-magi conclave of Dastorvol, allowing them to successfully escape their overrun planet without a single casualty. Garthalomews descendants have wielded Honours Bite in his name ever since.|

Those amongst their ranks who have struck the killing blow against such an enemy earn the right to bear the Headsman’s Mark. More than just a badge of respect, this amulet feeds the pilot with targeting data that bolsters their giant-slaying skills still further.|

This Relic replaces a cult sniper rifle and has the following profile:||true|GC|Genestealer Cults|This long-barrelled rifle is painted with the freely-given blood of the Patriarch, blessing the wielder with uncanny predatory instincts.

This Relic replaces a cult bonesword or Locus blades and has the following profile:||true|GC|Genestealer Cults|This peculiar sword has not one blade, but four bound as one. When its handle is given a sharp twist, the blade splits and splits again until it resembles a sheaf of gleaming tentacles - or a striking hydra - more than it does a conventional blade.

It is said to contain the departed spirit of Vockor Mai, known as the White Creeper, the scourge of New Gidlam’s aristocracy. When Vockor Mai’s charismatic allure proved ineffective against the hivelord Thorne due to a protective artefact, Mai crept into the mans bathhouse and slashed his throat with the razored edge of this metallic wyrm-form. In the legends of the Hivecult, the talisman harbours some of that malevolent and murderous intent to this day, and glows hot in the presence of those who have earned the cult’s ire.|

When installed in a Knight suit, it projects an energy barrier of far greater power than a standard ion shield. The Veil of Medrengard was originally gifted to the Fallen Nobles of House Garrasfor their service during the Horus Heresy, but has since been passed to many other Iconoclast houses.|

Hunted down as hereteks even by the members of their own creed, the dark adepts of the Xarisians were slaughtered and their malefic technologies destroyed.

Entire continents are stripped of resources and offered as tribute, while the inhabitants of whole cities are slaughtered in bloody sacrifice. Nor are these runes merely symbolic. In battle, the power of the warp pulsates from this banner, enrapturing the servants of darkness and binding them to the pilot’s will.|

Its final defence was led by Knight Centura Ordela Grendoth, whose null-field was anathema to the warp creatures. Gathalamor was liberated by Guilliman, but Grendoth was slain in the battle. Her bones have since been placed inside a reliquary that now possesses a fraction of her power.|
000002427|Bellicos bolt rifle|Chapter Relics|Model equipped with a master-crafted auto bolt rifle only. This Relic replaces a master-crafted auto bolt rifle and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The forge world of Bellicos was a hidden weapons-testing facility given dispensation to practise near heretical levels of technological innovation. Before it was swallowed by the Great Rift, the planet managed to dispatch a single cargo hauler containing prototype bolt rifles of an incredibly advanced pattern. These weapons are regarded with a borderline religious reverence for their bellicose lethality, and to wield one is considered a paramount honour.|
000002428|Lament|Chapter Relics|Model equipped with a master-crafted stalker bolt rifle only. This Relic replaces a master-crafted stalker bolt rifle and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Dark rumours abound that this weapon is so cruel of essence that those who wield it doom themselves as surely as those who fall under their sights. It is telling of the Space Marines’ selfless courage that they utilise the weapon regardless.|

It throws up a field of techno-spiritual dissonance that veils its wearer from sight and sensors, allowing them to slip across the battlefield like a wraith.|
000002430|Benediction of Fury|Chapter Relics|<span class="tooltip00639" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00639" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00639"><span class="kwb">CHAPLAIN</span></span> model only. This Relic replaces a Crozius Arcanum and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Borne on a dozen bloody and hard-fought crusades, this weapons unique empathokinetic circuitry has absorbed the bellicosity and righteous wrath of every Chaplain who has ever wielded it. As a result, it now strikes with the force of a thunderbolt.|
000002431|The Honour Vehement|Chapter Relics|The bearer has the following ability:<br>‘<span class="redfont">The Honour Vehement (Aura)</span>: While a friendly <span class="tooltip00536" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00536" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00536"><span class="kwb2">&lt;<span class="kwb3">C</span>HAPTER&gt;</span> <span class="kwb">CORE</span></span> unit is within 6" of the bearer, each time that unit fights, until that fight is resolved, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of models in that unit.

So potent is the inspirational value of the Emperor’s own evocation that not only those who bear it, but all their battle-brothers are driven into a relentless killing fury.|

Add 3" to the range of the bearer’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Aura-Abilities">aura abilities</a> (to a maximum of 9"). This does not increase the range of aura abilities that are psychic powers.||true|SM|Space Marines|Developed by Archmagos Cawl, the Vox Espiritum is a powerful neural amplifier that causes its wearer’s voxed utterances to resonate on a modulated and heavily warded frequency. Though still highly experimental and not altogether safe, it allows its user to project their bellowed commands - and sometimes even unspoken mental imperatives - directly into the minds of friend and foe alike.|
000002433|Purgatorus|Chapter Relics|Model equipped with a bolt pistol, heavy bolt pistol, master-crafted special issue bolt pistol or absolvor bolt pistol only. This Relic replaces a bolt pistol, heavy bolt pistol, master-crafted special issue bolt pistol or absolvor bolt pistol and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This bolt pistol is a true work of the artificers art. Since its forging in M35, many battle-brothers have used the pistol to purge traitors, tyrants and heretics from the Emperor’s realm. The weapon’s machine spirit is wrathful, its aim inescapable; in many ways, Purgatorus epitomises the very warriors who wield it.|

000002436|Soldier’s Blade|Relics of Macragge|Model equipped with power sword, master-crafted power sword, or combat knife only. This Relic replaces a power sword, master-crafted power sword or combat knife and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This deceptively simple sword has been a treasure of the Ultramarines since the Legion’s founding. Though it contains none of the matterdisruptive technology of a power sword, it can still carve through the thickest plates of ceramite and plasteel with ease. So perfectly forged is this monomolecular-edged blade that is has survived for millennia without ever needing to be sharpened.|

To all Ultramarines, it represents the unfaltering might of their home world and their Chapter. When an Ultramarine beholds this sacred standard, he is gripped with a sense of unshakeable pride and determination, for he knows that no enemy can match the skills in battle passed down to him and his brothers by their Primarch.|
000002438|Armour of Konor|Relics of Macragge|<span class="tooltip00643" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00643" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00643"><span class="kwb">TERMINATOR</span></span> only. A model with this Relic has a 4+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>. When resolving an attack against that model, halve any damage inflicted (rounding up).||true|SM|Space Marines|Gifted to the Ultramarines envoy to the forge world of Konor, this ornate suit of Terminator plate is constructed from thousands of microscopic layers of durable materials, applied painstakingly one by one. As a result, these plates retain their structure and protective qualities against even the most destructive strikes.|
000002439|Helm of Censure|Relics of Macragge|When resolving an attack made by a model with this Relic, you can re-roll a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a> of 1 and you can re-roll a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a> of 1.

The results of his pre-Heresy studies, which themselves were considered treasonous, outlined the optimal methods by which an Adeptus Astartes could kill any opponent, including a fellow battle-brother. Ten thousand years later, his works are still without equal.|
000002440|Vengeance of Ultramar|Relics of Macragge|Model equipped with a storm bolter only. This Relic replaces a storm bolter and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Last used during the Tyrannic Wars, this ancient storm bolter houses a ferocious machine spirit capable of a dramatically increased rate of fire. Furthermore, though the Vengeance of Ultramar fires standardissue bolts, a compact micro-forge within the weapon’s firing chamber anoints each projectile with a bio-reactive coating that burns away flesh and chitin like parchment in a raging fire.|
000002441|Tarentian Cloak|Relics of Macragge|A model with this Relic has a 5+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>. At the start of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>, that model regains D3 lost wounds.||true|SM|Space Marines|Discovered on the agri world of Tarentus, this shroud bears all the hallmarks of the Dark Age of Technology. The auto-sanctified medicae support systems and thrice-blessed bio-rejuvenators threaded throughout this cloak made it an invaluable artefact for the Ultramarines when battling Daemons in the planet’s desert wastes.|
000002442|Adamantine Mantle|Ultramarines Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.||true|SM|Space Marines|These flowing cloaks are laced through with threads of braided adamantine. When combined with armour and energy fields, it has been shown time and again that these symbols of office are proof against even the very strongest attacks.|
000002443|Artificer Armour|Ultramarines Special-issue Wargear|A model with this Relic has a Save characteristic of 2+ and a 5+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|Crafted by the finest artificers of the Chapter, these ornately detailed suits of armour provide superior protective capabilities that rival even Terminator plate. All who set eyes upon the wearer know that an honoured champion of the Imperium stands before them.|
000002444|Master-crafted Weapon|Ultramarines Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one weapon that model is equipped with (this cannot be a weapon whose profile includes the word ‘master-crafted’). Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that weapon. That weapon is considered to be a Chapter Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|Within the armouries of each Space Marine Chapter, the finest artificers seek to fashion weapons of ornate magnificence and utter lethality. Those forged upon Macragge are breathtaking examples of the weaponsmith’s craft, be they potent firearms or gilt-chased blades.|
000002445|Digital Weapons|Ultramarines Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic fights, it can make 1 additional attack using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Select-Weapon">close combat weapon</a> profile. When resolving that attack, if a hit is scored the target suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|Digital weapons are concealed lasers fitted into finger rings, bionic implants or the knuckles of a power-armoured gauntlet. Short-ranged and powerful, they are typically triggered in the midst of melee in order to blast the enemy point-blank from an unexpected angle when a weakness in their guard is spotted.|
000002446|Reliquary of Vengeance|Ultramarines Special-issue Wargear|Once per battle, at the start of the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a>, a model with this Relic can reveal the reliquary.

Occasionally, the ashes or bones of such a champion of Ultramar are preserved in a reliquary that can be borne into battle attached to an Ultramarine’s armour, there to inspire those who still live to fight all the harder in the slain hero’s name.|
000002447|Seal of Oath|Ultramarines Special-issue Wargear|At the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, select one enemy unit. Until the end of the battle, the bearer has the following ability:<br><br><span class="redfont">Seal of Oath (Aura)</span><b>:</b> While a friendly <span class="tooltip00642" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00642" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00642"><span class="kwb">ULTRAMARINES</span> <span class="kwb">CORE</span></span> or <span class="tooltip00644" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00644" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00644"><span class="kwb">ULTRAMARINES</span> <span class="kwb">CHARACTER</span></span> unit is within 6" of the bearer, each time a model in that unit makes an attack against the enemy unit you selected at the start of the first battle round, you can re-roll that attack’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a> and you can re-roll that attack’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|Many Ultramarines successor Chapters maintain a time-honoured tradition of swearing oaths to Guilliman and the Emperor before entering battle. These are recorded on strips of parchment by Chapter serfs and other servants before being blessed by Chaplains and then bonded to a chosen warrior’s armour with wax seals. Upholding such oaths is sacred, and their bearers would rather die than fail.|
000002448|Hellfury Bolts|Ultramarines Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/space-marines/#Bolt-Weapons">bolt weapon</a> that model is equipped with. When the bearer shoots with that weapon, you can choose for it to fire a hellfury bolt. If you do, you can only make one attack with that weapon, but when resolving that attack, if it scores a hit it inflicts 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> on the target and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|It was the Ultramarines who bore the brunt of the First Tyrannic War, and they and their successors have fought against this ghastly xenos threat countless times since. It was they who helped to develop these potent bolt rounds, impregnated with reservoirs of bio-reactive acids that burn living targets from the inside out.|
000002449|Sunwrath Pistol|Ultramarines Special-issue Wargear|Model equipped with a plasma pistol only. This Relic replaces a plasma pistol and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Belisarius Cawl gifted a score of these pistols to Roboute Guilliman at the start of the Indomitus Crusade, who in turn bequeathed them to warriors who displayed particular valour in the face of the enemy. Constructed with superior venting coils and with an inner barrel of a mysterious heat-conducting crystal, these plasma pistols can be fired repeatedly without overheating.|

000002451|The Hunter’s Eye|Relics of Chogoris|At the start of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE">Shooting phase</a>, you can select one friendly <span class="kwb">WHITE</span> <span class="kwb">SCARS</span> unit within 6" of a model from your army with this Relic. Until the end of the phase, when resolving an attack made with a ranged weapon by a model in that unit, the target does not receive the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-and-Cover">benefit of cover</a> to its <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw">saving throw</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|The tribes of Chogoris are famed throughout the Imperium for the consummate skill of their mounted archers. It is written in the Scrolls of the Plains that the Hunter’s Eye – an ingeniously constructed bionic eye of great age and unrivalled quality – was created in honour of this aspect of the White Scars’ heritage. This device picks out augurassessed weak spots in the quarry’s defences, enabling its wearer to strike with uncanny accuracy or to relay this information via datagheists to any other friendly forces engaging the target.|

The oldest relics of the Chapter date back to that ancient time, and the Banner of the Eagle is one such artefact. It is incredibly rare for this venerable standard to be brought forth into the crucible of war, though any wily commander knows the inspirational effect that such a sacred banner can have on those that fight in its fluttering shadow. At the crown of the banner sits a glorious adamantium eagle – the symbol of the White Scars’ bloody victory on Golgotha, from which the Banner of the Eagle took its name.|
000002453|Wrath of the Heavens|Relics of Chogoris|<span class="tooltip00647" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00647" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00647"><span class="kwb">BIKER</span></span> model only. A model with this Relic has a Move characteristic of 16". In the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>, that model can move over other models and <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-Features-1">terrain features</a> as if they were not there.||true|SM|Space Marines|This Space Marine bike was constructed to possess the speed of the storm itself. Fitted with a short-burn grav impeller, Wrath of the Heavens can perform jaw-dropping gravitic boosts over the battlefield. Thus, its rider can vault wrecked tanks and ferrocrete barricades, and can even hurtle over the heads of the foe.|
000002454|Scimitar of the Great Khan|Relics of Chogoris|Model equipped with a power sword, master-crafted power sword or relic blade only. This Relic replaces a power sword, master-crafted power sword or relic blade and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The White Scars’ armoury contains many swords forged in the style of traditional Chogorian tulwars. Of these, the most singular and storied is the Scimitar of the Great Khan. Chapter lore holds that this weapon was blessed by Jaghatai himself during the Purging of Daikeos. Soon after, the weapon’s bearer, his champion Ghorotei, struck the head from the Ironwyrm King in single combat.|

These purebred beasts were said to descend from the thundering herds of ancient Terra, and be imbued with an elemental swiftness that inspires all true sons of Chogoris.|
000002456|Glaive of Vengeance|Relics of Chogoris|Model equipped with a khan’s spear only. This Relic replaces a khan’s spear and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The Glaive of Vengeance was once wielded by the great Kyublai Khan, before his murder by the Drukhari of the Bloodied Talon. Some claim that the spirit of Kyublai Khan still clings to the glaive, and his endless thirst for vengeance grants the blade great power.|
000002457|Adamantine Mantle|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.||true|SM|Space Marines|These flowing cloaks are laced through with threads of braided adamantine. When combined with armour and energy fields, it has been shown time and again that these symbols of office are proof against even the very strongest attacks.|
000002458|Artificer Armour|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|A model with this Relic has a Save characteristic of 2+ and a 5+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|Crafted by the finest artificers of the Chapter, these ornately detailed suits of armour provide superior protective capabilities that rival even Terminator plate. All who set eyes upon the wearer know that an honoured champion of the Imperium stands before them.|
000002459|Master-crafted Weapon|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one weapon that model is equipped with (this cannot be a weapon whose profile includes the word ‘master-crafted’). Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that weapon. That weapon is considered to be a Chapter Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|Within the armouries of each Space Marine Chapter, the finest artificers seek to fashion weapons of ornate magnificence and utter lethality. The weapons of Chogoris have machine spirits as ferocious as raging aduu, and deliver the full fury of the storm.|
000002460|Digital Weapons|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic fights, it can make 1 additional attack using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Select-Weapon">close combat weapon</a> profile. When resolving that attack, if a hit is scored the target suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|Digital weapons are concealed lasers fitted into finger rings, bionic implants or the knuckles of a power-armoured gauntlet. Short-ranged and powerful, they are typically triggered in the midst of melee in order to blast the enemy point-blank from an unexpected angle when a weakness in their guard is spotted.|
000002461|Equis-pattern bolt pistol|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|Model equipped with a bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol only. This Relic replaces a bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The Techmarines of the White Scars have walked the line of heresy more than once with their fiercely independent approach to adapting STC technologies. The Equis is one such instance, a variant bolt pistol design that strains the capabilities of the gun’s machine spirit to the limit by firing rapid flurries of bolts as its wielder charges into battle. Equis-pattern weapons are rare; their hyper-accelerated rate of fire soon burns out their mechanisms, martyring the pistols within a few short years of battle.|
000002462|Headtaker’s Trophies|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|Subtract 1 from the Leadership characteristic of enemy units whilst they are within 6" of a model from your army with this Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|Many sons of the Khan display the polished skulls of the greatest of their conquered enemies upon their armour on large trophy racks. Those who oppose these swift warriors are filled with dread, for even the mightiest champions cannot help but envision their own severed head becoming a macabre decoration atop those gleaming spikes.|

When the bearer shoots with that weapon, you can choose for it to fire a stormwrath bolt. If you do, you can only make one attack with that weapon, but the weapon has a Strength characteristic of 7 and an Armour Penetration characteristic of -1 for that attack. If the target of that attack is a <span class="kwb">MONSTER</span>, the weapon has a Damage characteristic of D6 for that attack.||true|SM|Space Marines|Fashioned according to ancient designs by Chogorian artificers and intended for use in hunting the macro-predators of the Khum Karta Mountains, these acid-etched bolt shells contain a secret alchemical propellant formula, and their explosive cores are laced with fulgurite that strikes like caged lightning within the target.|

Circling high above the battlefield, the cyber eagle feeds a constant stream of optic and auspex data to the helm’s wearer, overlaying their autosenses with targeting projections and auto-prognosticatory hostile proximity alerts.|

000002481|The Armour of Shadows|Relics of Ravenspire|When resolving an attack made with a weapon that has an Armour Penetration characteristic of -1 against a model from your army with this Relic, that weapon is treated as having an Armour Penetration characteristic of 0. In addition, when resolving an attack against a model from your army with this Relic, an unmodified <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a> of 1, 2 or 3 always fails.||true|SM|Space Marines|The beautifully crafted plates of this mysterious armour articulate without the slightest sound, while its power pack emits barely more than a purr. Stranger still, a cowl of shadows seems to hang around the wearer, billowing like smoke when they move.|

The scrimshawed raven skull talisman retrieved from Korvaad’s body is said to bestow his legendary might upon its wearer, and should it fall into enemy hands, the Chapter will spare no effort to recover it.|
000002483|Ex Tenebris|Relics of Ravenspire|Model equipped with a master-crafted stalker bolt rifle, master-crafted occulus bolt carbine or master-crafted instigator bolt carbine only. This Relic replaces a master-crafted stalker bolt rifle, master-crafted occulus bolt carbine or master-crafted instigator bolt carbine and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Ex Tenebris is a masterwork bolter fitted with an incredibly sophisticated telescopic scope system. Chapter legend has it that the weapon was forged by Corax himself, as a gift for his wayward brother, the Night Haunter. But the Horus Heresy turned the two Primarchs’ Legions against one another, and Ex Tenebris was instead borne into battle by heroes of the Raven Guard.|
000002484|Oppressor’s End|Relics of Ravenspire|Model equipped with combat knife only. This Relic replaces a combat knife and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Wreathed in a shimmering power field, the monomolecular edge of this unassuming blade has cut short the reigns of countless oppressors, tyrants and demagogues.|
000002485|Adamantine Mantle|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.||true|SM|Space Marines|These flowing cloaks are laced through with threads of braided adamantine. When combined with armour and energy fields, it has been shown time and again that these symbols of office are proof against even the very strongest attacks.|
000002486|Artificer Armour|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|A model with this Relic has a Save characteristic of 2+ and a 5+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|Crafted by the finest artificers of the Chapter, these ornately detailed suits of armour provide superior protective capabilities that rival even Terminator plate. All who set eyes upon the wearer know that an honoured champion of the Imperium stands before them.|
000002487|Master-crafted Weapon|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one weapon that model is equipped with (this cannot be a weapon whose profile includes the word ‘master-crafted’). Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that weapon. That weapon is considered to be a Chapter Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|The forging of surpassingly lethal blades and firearms is regarded as a sacred art on Kiavahr, where entire sanctums of artifice are given over to the arming of the greatest Raven Guard heroes.|
000002488|Digital Weapons|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic fights, it can make 1 additional attack using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Select-Weapon">close combat weapon</a> profile. When resolving that attack, if a hit is scored the target suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|Digital weapons are concealed lasers fitted into finger rings, bionic implants or the knuckles of a power-armoured gauntlet. Short-ranged and powerful, they are typically triggered in the midst of melee in order to blast the enemy point-blank from an unexpected angle when a weakness in their guard is spotted.|
000002489|Shadowmaster Cloak|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|A model with this Relic has a 3+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a> whilst they are wholly on or in a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-Features-1">terrain</a> feature.||true|SM|Space Marines|Woven from helical strands of auto-prognostic Kiavahran mirrorsteel, a Shadowmaster Cloak allows its wearer to blend seamlessly into their surroundings, making them masters of evasion and ambush.|
000002490|Silentus Pistol|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|Model equipped with bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol only. This Relic replaces a bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The lost forge world of Vantius specialised in creating weapons of silent murder. Ironically it was overrun by an assault by Drukhari Mandrakes, but not before a handful of its secrets had been preserved by the Raven Guard. The highly classified Silentus modification rituals that came from Vantius elevate bolt sidearms into softly spoken but utterly lethal assassination weapons.|
000002491|Korvidari Bolts|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/space-marines/#Bolt-Weapons">bolt weapon</a> that model is equipped with. When that model is chosen to shoot with, you can choose for that weapon to fire a korvidari bolt. If you do, when choosing targets for that model and when choosing ranged weapons, that weapon’s Range characteristic is increased by 6" and it can target units that are not visible to the bearer, but only one attack can be made with that weapon.||true|SM|Space Marines|Etched with raven-feather charms, the abnormally long casings of korvidari bolts are packed with extra propellant for superior range. Each bolt also houses a minute, hyper-sensitive targeting and flight correction relay, allowing for a marksman’s accuracy even against heavily obscured foes.|
000002492|Shard of Isstvan|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of a model with this Relic. In addition, the bearer has the following ability:<br><br><b>Shard of Isstvan (Aura):</b> While a friendly <span class="kwb">RAVEN</span> <span class="kwb">GUARD</span> unit is within 6" of the bearer, each time a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Morale-Tests">Morale test</a> is taken for that unit, it is automatically passed.||true|SM|Space Marines|Following the Raven Guard’s escape from Isstvan V at the outset of the Horus Heresy, Corax gifted each of his surviving Legionaries with a shard of his shattered armour. Though most of these shards are now lost, some are still preserved in reliquaries or worn as talismans, each one acting as a potent source of hope and courage.|

Add 1 to the Toughness characteristic of a model with this Relic. When resolving an attack made against that model, reduce any damage inflicted by 1, to a minimum of 1.||true|SM|Space Marines|Inspired by Cawl’s new marks of battle plate, the Iron Fathers sanctioned the creation of the Aegis Ferrum. Forged by the combined effort of artificers hailing from every clan company, the armour’s indomitable resilience is said to symbolise the Chapter’s own.|
000002496|The Mindforge|Relics of Medusa|Model equipped with a force sword, force axe or force stave only. This Relic replaces a force sword, force axe or force stave and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Consisting of a web of psycho-circuitry that is relayed through the wearer’s helm and gauntlets and into the force weapon they wield, this remarkable device possesses a rudimentary machine sentience. It bonds irrevocably with its host, augmenting their strength and optimising the blaze of psychic power that surges through their chosen weapon.|
000002497|Betrayer’s Bane|Relics of Medusa|Model equipped with a combi-melta only. This Relic replaces a combi-melta and has the following profile:<br><br>When you choose this weapon to shoot with, select one or both of the profiles below. If you select both, subtract 1 from <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit rolls</a> for attacks made with this weapon.||true|SM|Space Marines|This combi-weapon contains an auto-sanctified thermal generator that allows it to fire at an accelerated rate. Its case is inscribed with the name of every battlefield upon which it has slain warriors of the Emperor’s Children, and serves as a potent symbol of vengeance.|
000002498|The Ironstone|Relics of Medusa|At the start of each battle round, select one friendly <span class="tooltip00651" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00651" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00651"><span class="kwb">IRON</span> <span class="kwb">HANDS</span> <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span></span> unit within 3" of the bearer. Until the start of your next battle round, when resolving an attack made against that <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> unit, if the bearer is within 3" of that <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> unit you can reduce any damage suffered by 1, to a minimum of 1 (this is not cumulative with any other rules that reduce damage).||true|SM|Space Marines|This device is mag-clamped to the gorget of the bearer, where it gathers power from his armour, gradually awakening the cluster of potent machine spirits that lurk within its coldly glowing shell. When a nearby vehicle suffers battle damage, the Ironstone connects to the beleaguered machine, possesses its spirit and swiftly begins guiding repairs of the damage.|
000002499|The Tempered Helm|Relics of Medusa|Whilst a model from your army with this Relic is on the battlefield, you can roll one D6 for each <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Command-Points">Command Point</a> you spend to use a Stratagem; on a 5+ that Command Point is refunded. You can only have 1 Command Point refunded per battle round by this Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|The savant-processor within this helm filters incoming information and presents it in compartmentalised strategic sermons, granting a near-omnipotent level of instant battlefield cognition.|
000002500|The Gorgon’s Chain|Relics of Medusa|A model with this Relic has a 4+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>. When resolving an attack made with a ranged weapon against that model, subtract 1 from the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|This small augmetic module is fitted within its owner’s armour, linking through his black carapace and extending monomolecular mechadendrites into his hearts. Thus connected, it draws power from its owner to generate a potent protective field that robs incoming shots of their strength.|
000002501|Adamantine Mantle|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.||true|SM|Space Marines|These flowing cloaks are laced through with threads of braided adamantine. When combined with armour and energy fields, it has been shown time and again that these symbols of office are proof against even the very strongest attacks.|
000002502|Artificer Armour|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|A model with this Relic has a Save characteristic of 2+ and a 5+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|Crafted by the finest artificers of the Chapter, these ornately detailed suits of armour provide superior protective capabilities that rival even Terminator plate.

Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that weapon. That weapon is considered to be a Chapter Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|Where other Chapters labour long in the decoration of their finest blades and firearms, the Iron Hands care only for functionality. Of course, any who would denigrate the works of Medusa’s skilled sons are soon silenced when the power of these weapons is unleashed. |
000002504|Digital Weapons|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic fights, it can make 1 additional attack using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Select-Weapon">close combat weapon</a> profile. When resolving that attack, if a hit is scored the target suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|Digital weapons are concealed lasers fitted into finger rings, bionic implants or the knuckles of a power-armoured gauntlet – in the case of the Iron Hands they have been known to replace entire digits. Short-ranged and powerful, they are typically triggered in the midst of melee in order to blast the enemy from an unexpected angle.|
000002505|Auto-medicae Bionics|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|If a model with this Relic has lost any wounds, at the start of your turn it regains up to D3 lost wounds.||true|SM|Space Marines|Some of the most complex bionics grafted onto the sons of Ferrus Manus incorporate systems similar to an Apothecary’s narthecium gauntlet. Rapid-suture applicators, hyper-adrenaline dispensers and the like render a warrior so augmented as to be almost indestructible.|
000002506|Teeth of Mars|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|Model equipped with an Astartes chainsword only. This Relic replaces an Astartes chainsword and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The Iron Hands and their successors share a close bond with the Mechanicus of Mars. Thosewho show a particular affinity for communing with machines may be granted a cog-toothed chainsword bearing the sigil of the Omnissiah. Such blades were developed in concert between Mars and Medusa, and are believed to have been blessed by the Machine God to bring ruination to impure machines.|
000002507|Haywire Bolts|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/space-marines/#Bolt-Weapons">bolt weapon</a> that model is equipped with. When the bearer shoots with that weapon, you can choose for it to fire a haywire bolt. If you do, you can only make one attack with that weapon, but when resolving that attack, if it is made against a <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> unit, an unmodified <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a> of 4-5 inflicts D3 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a> on the target in addition to any other damage, and an unmodified wound roll of 6 inflicts 3 mortal wounds on the target in addition to any other damage.||true|SM|Space Marines|Containing implosive cores refined from Medusa’s electro-conductive sagatellum ore and guided by auto-fulminatory machine spirits, these bolt rounds detonate with crackling blasts that exorcise hostile machine spirits and burn out cogitator circuitry.|

When a model with this Relic uses their <span class="redfont">Blessing of the Omnissiah</span> ability, roll two dice when determining how many lost wounds are regained and discard one of the results.||true|SM|Space Marines|The Techmarines of the Iron Hands and their successors have a much stronger affinity with the machine spirits of their weapons and vehicles than those from most other Chapters. Fortis-pattern data spikes allow these warrior-priests to commune directly with the machines, both to placate their spirits and to facilitate more efficient repairs. |

Staganda had been severed from Mankind since the Dark Age of Technology and, by the time an Explorator fleet rediscovered the world, the population had been living under brutal Ork occupation for millennia. Though the entire Imperial Fists Chapter was mobilised to reclaim the planet, it was the 3rd Company that bore the brunt of the fighting. In the aftermath, a new standard was fashioned in honour of this epic victory.|
000002513|The Eye of Hypnoth|Relics of the Fists|<span class="kwb">IMPERIAL</span> <span class="kwb">FISTS</span> model only.

Kromak. This device is a highly sophisticated and long-ranged auspex array; tradition dictates that it is best employed to detect hidden weaknesses in enemy fortifications.|

The stories of Osrak’s defeat of the nine Daemon Lords of the Maelstrom may well be apocryphal, as might his cleansing of the plague vessel Morbiditus. The toppling of the Gallowfortress, the sundering of the Inimical Gate and the single-handed liberation of Shormidar – all of these are deeds attributed to Osrak that may have grown in the telling. Whatever the truth of these stories, none contest Osrak’s sheer psychic might. Even now, centuries after his death, the scrimshawed remains of his skull radiate a formidable power. With proper training, a Librarian of the same gene-seed can bend the Bones of Osrak to his will, accomplishing feats beyond the ken of his fellow psykers.|
000002515|Duty’s Burden|Relics of the Fists|<span class="kwb">CRIMSON</span> <span class="kwb">FISTS</span> model with a master-crafted auto bolt rifle or master-crafted stalker bolt rifle only. This Relic replaces a master-crafted auto bolt rifle or master-crafted stalker bolt rifle, and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Presented to Chapter Master Kantor by Roboute Guilliman upon the day of his departure from Rynn’s World, this masterfully crafted bolt rifle serves as a mark of the Primarch’s recognition for all the Crimson Fists have achieved, and a stark reminder of all there is still yet to do. Bestowed upon those champions of the Chapter who face especially trying and crucial battles, Duty’s Burden is an exceptionally lethal and utterly trustworthy weapon whose determined machine spirit echoes that of the Crimson Fists themselves.|

Though its motes of psychic awareness are diffused throughout its carrier like a virus, it acts with a singular will. Subverting the body and symbiotes of its host, pathogenesis causes rapid mutation: cartilaginous tubes and containment spines are lengthened; intercostal muscles are engorged; bio-ammunition is sheathed in a toxic dermis. With its host’s reach and lethality extended, fragments of pathogenesis can stretch out to the bodies of many more prey, by infesting the bio-ammunition or riding through the bioelectric charge. Whether it aims only to spread itself or is actively seeking something in the bodies of its fallen foes, perhaps only time will tell.|

Carried to war by those kill teams expected toplunge into the heart of the xenos hordes, it has saved countless lives, the bearer and his team fighting to victory as the dome-like force field keeps the worst of the alien scum at bay.|

Where other such devices are made from sanctified platinum, the Osseus Key is made from the,hand and finger bones of deceased Imperial Fist heroes that fought in the Horus Heresy, scrimshawed with inhuman care and imbued with the fiercest machine spirits of the age. No portal can bar its bearer from entry, and no xenos machine can stand before his wrath.|
000003194|The Thief of Secrets|Relics of the Watch Fortresses|Model equipped with power sword, master-crafted power sword or xenophase blade only. This Relic replaces a power sword, master-crafted power sword or xenophase blade and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The power sword known as the Thief of Secrets is inhabited by a machine spirit that has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. It has tasted the vitae of countless alien races, absorbing those liquids through auto-sanctified sanguinator-channels and codifying them through the honeycombed array oflogicum cells within. The biological secrets of many xenos races have thus been laid bare, allowing the blades user to modulate its power field, the better to slice through chitinous armour, rupture xenoform organs and burn out alien nervous systems with ease.|
000003195|The Tome of Ectoclades|Relics of the Watch Fortresses|Once per battle, in your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#COMMAND-PHASE">Command phase</a>, you can use the Tome of Ectoclades. If you do, select one datasheet used by a unit from your opponent’s army.

The bearer can ascertain the vulnerabilities of those he is about to face - such knowledge has, in the past, saved not only the book’s custodian but entire worlds.|
000003196|Adamantine Mantle|Relics of the Watch Fortresses|Each time the bearer would lose a wound, roll one D6: on a 5+, that wound is not lost.||true|SM|Space Marines|Though few of these flowing cloaks bear much more than cryptic watch fortress symbolism or simple patterns of office, within their fabric are hidden threads of braided adamantine that can withstand even the most determined enemy attack.|
000003197|Master-crafted Weapon|Relics of the Watch Fortresses|When you select this Relic, select one weapon the bearer is equipped with (this cannot be a Relic or a weapon whose profile includes the word 'master-crafted’). Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that weapon. That weapon is considered to be a Chapter Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|Worked upon by the watch fortress’ experienced Techmarines, occupying the entire lives of mortal artificers and calibrated by specially sanctioned tech-magi, these priceless weapons are commissioned to honour the confirmed eradication of especially significant xenos horrors.|
000003198|Digital Weapons|Relics of the Watch Fortresses|Each time the bearer fights, it can make 1 additional attack using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Select-Weapon">close combat weapon</a> profile. Each time you make that attack, if a hit is scored, the target suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|Digital weapons are concealed armaments fitted into ornamentation, bionic implants or the knuckles of a power-armoured gauntlet. Some fire high-powered lasers, toxin-coated nano-needles or far less common ammunition; the Deathwatch possess a great deal of undisclosed technology.|
000003199|Artificer Armour|Relics of the Watch Fortresses|The bearer has a Save characteristic of 2+ and has a 5+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|Crafted by the finest artificers to the highest specifications, these ornate suits of armour provide superior protective capabilities that rival even Terminator plate. Some are engraved with depictions of the vile creatures the wearer has struck down during his long vigil.|

It forms a fibrous medium that shields the warriors most vital biosystems.|
000003201|Spear of the First Vigil|Relics of the Watch Fortresses|Model equipped with vigil spear only. This Relic replaces a vigil spear and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This ancient vigil spear was presented to the first Watch Masters of the Deathwatch at the time of the Chapter s founding. Wound around its shaft in nano-script a molecule thick is the earliest known and most extensive example of the Litany Xenomortis; some verses are so archaic and esoteric that their true meaning is now unknown.|

With the Soul Fortress, xenos-hunting Librarians have delved into the dens of psychically gifted alien horrors without fear of taint, their minds girded against auras of soul-draining enervation.|
000003203|Banebolts of Eryxia|Relics of the Watch Fortresses|When you select this Relic, select one <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/space-marines/#Bolt-Weapons">bolt weapon</a> the bearer is equipped with.

If you do, you can only make one attack with that weapon, but that attack has a Strength characteristic of 6, an AP characteristic of -2 and a Damage of 3.||true|SM|Space Marines|Arch-Magister Eryxia spent her entire life in search of the perfect bolt shell. She spent decades working with the Deathwatch, perfecting not only the specialist ammunition of their Chapter, but also their magazines. Some of her finest creations are still extant, housed within ammunition clips chased in platinum. Whatever the nature of the foe, just one of Eryxias Banebolts, when delivered to the centre mass, can slay its target in a second.|
000003204|Vhorkan-pattern Auspicator|Relics of the Watch Fortresses|The bearer has the following ability: ‘<span class="redfont">Omnikinopticon (Aura)</span>: While a friendly <span class="tooltip00707" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00707" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00707"><span class="kwb">DEATHWATCH</span> <span class="kwb">CORE</span></span> unit is within 6" of the bearer, each time a model in that unit makes a ranged attack against a unit that can <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Flying"><span class="kwb">FLY</span></a>, add 1 to that attack’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a>.’||true|SM|Space Marines|This omnikinoptic device was the only one of its kind to escape the purge that saw its creator executed. Telian Vhorkan, an accomplished scopticrat, created this scryer unit by incorporating his unwilling underlings into the auspicator’s enmeshed logic drives. From there, they plot oracular dynamics and feed the prophetic data to nearby receivers.|

This Relic replaces a force stave and has the following profile:||true|TS|Thousand Sons|This staff was fashioned from the sorcerously crystallized fires of a Tzeentchian Firelord.

000003637|Adamantine Mantle|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|Each time the bearer would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.||true|SM|Space Marines|These flowing cloaks are laced through with threads of braided adamantine. When combined with armour and energy fields, it has been shown time and again that these symbols of office are proof against even the very strongest attacks.|
000003638|Artificer Armour|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|The bearer has a Save characteristic of 2+ and a 5+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|Crafted by the finest artificers of the Chapter, these ornately detailed suits of armour provide superior protective capabilities that rival even Terminator plate. All who set eyes upon the wearer know that an honoured champion of the Imperium stands before them.|
000003639|Master-crafted Weapon|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|When you give a model this Relic, select one weapon that model is equipped with (this cannot be a Relic or a weapon whose profile includes the word ‘master-crafted’). Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that weapon. That weapon is considered to be a Chapter Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|The armouries of many Crusades are full of ancient weapons crafted by the most skilled artificers. Many of these weapons date back thousands of years and are all the more powerful for their provenance.|
000003640|Digital Weapons|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|Each time the bearer fights, it can make 1 additional attack using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Select-Weapon">close combat weapon</a> profile. If that attack scores a hit, the target suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|Digital weapons are concealed lasers fitted into finger rings, bionic implants or the knuckles of a power-armoured gauntlet. Short-ranged and powerful, they are typically triggered in the midst of melee in order to blast the enemy point-blank from an unexpected angle when a weakness in their guard is spotted.|
000003641|Aquila Immortalis|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|Add 1 to the bearers Toughness and Attacks characteristics.||true|SM|Space Marines|This emblem was smelted and reconsecrated from destroyed relics found in shrines desecrated by the enemies of the Emperor. Awarded to those who have distinguished themselves on the battlefield, they speak to the fortitude and fury of the bearer.|
000003642|Perdition’s Edge|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|Model with a power axe or master-crafted power axe only. This Relic replaces a power axe or master-crafted power axe and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|With blades carved from noctilith, these axes separate the victims soul from the warp briefly as the deathblow is delivered. What is only a moment in reality feels like an eternity of damnation to the departing spirit, punishment for their sins against the immortal Emperor.|
000003643|Breath of the Throne|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|Model with a combi-flamer or auto-flamer only. This Relic replaces the flamer profile of a combi-flamer or auto-flamer and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|While appearing to be of a standard pattern, and fuelled by normal promethium, the flames that emit from this weapon burns incandescent. Those who are graced by their touch feel the wrath of the Emperors divine light upon them.|
000003644|Tännhauser’s Bones|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|Each time an attack is allocated to the bearer, the Damage characteristic of that attack is changed to 1.||true|SM|Space Marines|Marshal Tännhauser was martyred at the hands of the Black Legion at the decisive battle of the Rutgers Reach Crusade. His bones, encased in small reliquaries, were distributed among the warriors of that crusade during the victory sermon. Each is a potent reminder of duty and the expectations placed upon every Black Templar.|
000003645|Light of the Emperor’s Grace|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|<ul><li>Add 1 to the Leadership characteristic of models in this unit.</li><li>This model has the following ability: <span class="redfont">Light of the Emperor’s Grace (Aura)</span><b>:</b> While an enemy <span class="kwb">PSYKER</span> unit is within 12" of this model, subtract 1 from <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">Psychic tests</a> taken for that unit.</li></ul>||true|SM|Space Marines|This elaborate lantern casts a wan light over the bearer and his allies, fortifying them and driving back the darkness.|
000003646|Sigismund’s Seal|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|At the start of the first battle round, select one enemy unit that is on the battlefield. Until the end of the battle, each time a melee attack is made by this model’s unit against that enemy unit, you can re-roll the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a> and you can re-roll the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|This sheet of paper-thin adamantine is inscribed with an oath of moment taken by Sigismund under the gaze of the Emperor himself.|
000003647|Holy Orb|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|Once per battle, in your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE">Shooting phase</a>, you can select one enemy unit that is within 6" of and visible to this model.<br><ul><li>Roll one D6: on a 2+, that unit suffers D3 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a>.</li><li>Until the end of the turn, that unit is not eligible to fight until after all eligible units from your army have done so.</li></ul>||true|SM|Space Marines|Each holy orb is a masterpiece, combining explosives with sacred unguents. When thrown, the orb explodes, superheating the unguents into a cloud of scalding incense. Unbelievers who inhale this are sent into a paroxysm of agony, while they contemplate their many sins.|
000003648|The Crux Obsidian|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|Each time an attack is allocated to this model, subtract 1 from the Damage characteristic of that attack (to a minimum of 1).||true|SM|Space Marines|This shoulder pad and the carved Chapter emblem it bears symbolise the spirit of the eternal crusade. To wear it upon your armour is to be an avatar of the unbreakable will of the undying Emperor.|
000003649|Fist of Balthus|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|Model with power fist only, The Fist of Balthus replaces a power fist and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This power fist was worn by Brother Balthus, martyred even as he crushed the life from the Daemon Prince Angorakh the Red Herald. Angorakh’s acidic ichor still marks the metal of this weapon, but its strikes are undiminished.|
000003650|Beastpyre|Relics of the Eternal Crusade|Model with flamer or pyreblaster only. Beastpyre replaces this model’s flamer or pyreblaster and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Reconstructed from a flamer recovered from the ruins of the Temple of the Emperor Ascendant on Armageddon, this weapon has been lovingly reworked to bring purifying flame to the Emperor’s foes once more.|

So it did, yet as that star set, so the light faded and the Cosmic Serpent realised it had been fooled. Its wrath grew more terrible as the star’s light slipped away; so it is with this blade, said to be fashioned from the very fang that the Laughing God stole. As the hour grows later and the battle’s crescendo draws nigh, so the blade flashes ever faster through the air, chased by shuddering, shadowy after-images that solidify suddenly into their own stabbing fangs.|

This Relic replaces an Aeldari power sword and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|An exquisite and perfectly weighted weapon, the Storied Sword has a starmetal blade and a tooled wraithbone grip. Inscribed upon the sword in minute script is the entire tale of the Fall of the Aeldari, as narrated by the Shadowseers. As the wielder of this weapon fights, they find their mind filling with images of that terrible time - impossible psychic snapshots of the greatest tragedy ever to befall their race. Driven into a killing fury by the horrors they have seen, the wielder fights all the harder, determined to prevent any such terrible events from transpiring ever again.|

For most beings, wearing such a thing would be a death sentence. For the perfectly poised Harlequins, it is a thrilling challenge and a potent weapon, allowing them to slice and stab their enemies with every weave, dodge and pirouette they perform.|

This Relic replaces a shuriken pistol and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|This masterwork shuriken pistol was first bestowed upon a Troupe Master of the Veiled Path. Supposedly, it was given as a gift by a wanderer of the webway, who members of that masque claim was none other than the Laughing God. While many doubt the word of the Veiled Path in this, there can be no denying that Crescendo is a beautifully crafted and uniquely potent firearm. When the pistol’s trigger is pulled, micro-distortion engines engage within its housing, allowing an impossible volley of firepower to be unleashed.|

This Relic replaces a Harlequin’s kiss and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|Representing the barbed gift given in jest by the Laughing God to the crone Morai-Heg, Cegorach’s Rose contains thorned monofilaments of shadowsilk. Existing in the penumbra between realspace and the labyrinth dimension, these shadowsilk strands bypass even the thickest armour as though it did not exist. Once within the body of the victim, the rose’s threads uncoil, a blossom of molecule-thin blades unfurling at the end of each. The foe is slain instantly as a thicket of bloody, bladed roses blossoms within their chest.|

Yet when the wearer moves, they are engulfed in a shimmering cloud of refracted starlight that blinds and confuses the foe. This effect is magnified when the wearer moves quickly, the blurred glow swelling to become a blazing corona almost impossible to see through. So does the wearer mimic Aelos, the heavenly star flung by Cegorach himself that smote Vaul’s treacherous assistant Ghaevyll and blinded him for his deceits.|

Psychic powers flicker and die in the pendant’s presence, for the Laughing God will not suffer his children to be beset by any tendril of the warp. This aura of abnegation extends not only to the pendant’s wearer, but billows like a concealing cloak to shield nearby allies. So does Cegorach watch over his followers, guarding them from the predations of She Who Thirsts.|
000003851|The Avenging Blade|Aspect Shrine Relics|<a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/aeldari/Dire-Avengers">Dire Avenger Exarch</a> model with diresword only. This Relic replaces a diresword and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|This diresword contains the spirit stone of an ancient Exarch who was slain in agony after being betrayed by those of the Dark Kin. Each strike with the blade unleashes this fallen Exarch’s fury in searing bursts of psychic energy.|

This Relic replaces a biting blade and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|This biting blade is said by some to be the sister to Isirmathil, the mighty weapon of the Phoenix Lord Karandras. Its deadly teeth slice through the foe with barely a whisper.|

000003856|The Spider’s Bite|Aspect Shrine Relics|<a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/aeldari/Warp-Spiders">Warp Spider Exarch</a> model with powerblades only. This Relic replaces powerblades and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|These blades contain microscopic pores filled with the venom of the arachnoids that inhibit the craftworld’s infinity circuit.

Although its daemonic ties cause it to be regarded as highly dangerous, within its shimmering weave the deathless blessing of Ynnead is exceedingly powerful.|

This Relic replaces a Harlequin’s kiss and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|The monofilament wire encased within this ornate Harlequin’s kiss is incredibly tightly wound. When the weapon pierces the target’s body, this lashing wire flails around as though with a life of its own, tearing the victim to bloody pieces and lacerating their fellows. This horrific dismemberment - and the subsequent look of horror on the faces of the victim’s comrades - brings great amusement to the bearer, their mocking laughter echoing across the battlefield.|

This Relic replaces a Banshee blade or witchblade and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|This legendary blade is said to be forged from the severed hand of one of Khaine’s Avatars, by the inhabitants of a craftworld lost shortly after the Fall. The weapon’s glowing red spirit stone is said to contain the amalgamated spirits of every Young King that was sent into that Avatar’s chamber. When grasped, blood drips from the bearer’s gauntlets, and a fell light glows from their eyes. Enemies struck by the blade feel their life force absorbed, and even the tiniest nick caused by its edge refuses to heal.|

This Relic replaces an Aeldari power sword or Banshee blade and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|The spirit stones bonded to this blade simmer with barely restrained fury. When the sword bites into its foe, this anger is released in a surge of entropic energy, withering the victim and siphoning their life force. Once drained of its essence, the target’s shrivelled husk is blasted apart.|
000003863|Soulsever Pistol|Treasures of the Aeldari|<span class="tooltip00769" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00769" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00769"><span class="kwb">YNNARI</span></span> model with shuriken pistol only.

As it cuts through its victim, it snags a portion of their soul, dragging it from their ravaged form.|

Tech-Magi instead whisper that its machine spirit is aggravated. Yet when shouted prayers are made to Mina, the sword’s capacitors flood it with barely-suppressed energy and when it is driven into heretic flesh the super-heated blade immolates its victim.|

Of all the sacred statues raised to honour Mina’s final battle, the Icon of the Crimson Martyr is held in special reverence by her Order. Imagifiers who bear it to battle have been known to fight on through seemingly mortal wounds, their stentorian voices conveying the truth of Mina’s martyrdom to those around. With shouted conviction, they tell their Sisters how, when the hour is darkest and foes close upon them, then will ferocious dedication, faith and skill at arms see even the most indomitable foe cast down in bloody damnation.|
000003868|The Night’s Blade|Chapter Relics|<span class="kwb">VANGUARD</span> <span class="kwb">SPEARHEAD</span> model equipped with a combat knife or paired combat blades only. This Relic replaces a combat knife or paired combat blades and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This поп-reflective blade lacks the ornamentation seen on many Adeptus Astartes legendary weapons. Its seemingly humble design belies its dreaded power, and a number of dark myths surround reports of Space Marines wielding such a weapon. The killing edge of The Nights Blade contains a neural-shock net. ’This device overloads the victims senses as it pierces their flesh, silencing unsuspecting sentries who fall without so much as a whimper.|

While its power plant and fibre bundles operate with hardly a whisper, the Armour Umbral projects a barely-perceptible aural rendering of the surrounding soundscape, masking the wearers presence with the sigh of the wind and the rustle of vegetation. Coupled with a shrouding field that returns a wash of false signals to targeting systems, the warrior is as good as a ghost.|
000003870|Shadow’s Touch|Chapter Relics|<span class="kwb">VANGUARD</span> <span class="kwb">SPEARHEAD</span> model equipped with a force sword only. This Relic replaces a force sword and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The psycho-crystalline matrix at this blades core responds to the bearers mastery of psychic shadow and deceit.

A phase-modulated plasma field wreathes a polytrinate blade that has been witnessed to cut through feet-thick armour plating - and even energy fields - as though they were not there. It is said within the Hegemony that so deadly a weapon must only be wielded in a truly justified conflict against a deserving foe.|

Painstakingly wrought using conflicting harmonic abrasion fields rather than hammer blows, and shot through with a core of hyperdense stelanictite, the crest projects a complex gravitic repulsion field that can be directed by the bearer against their foes. Bludgeoned and restrained by clashing grav-waves, the enemy is held at bay long enough for the crest’s bearer and their comrades to press forward and lay them low.|

It is a great honour and responsibility to bring such an artefact to war, and should the bearer fall in battle, it is said the Votann themselves will wreak their vengeance upon the foe.|

This Relic replaces a mass hammer and has the following profile:||true|LoV|Leagues of Votann|This potent hammer was fashioned for High Kâhl Ynnôk Orkhunter by the notoriously irascible craftsman Krynn the Furious. Exactor requires its wielder to swing it at precisely the correct angle in order to get the best from the weapon - a testament to Krynn’s legendarily high expectations of all those around him. However, when it impacts correctly, Exactor unleashes a devastating shock wave of power that not even the most formidable foes can survive.|

These are badges of high office, denoting that the individual speaks with the authority of the Ancestors. They are typically ceremonial - rarely used in combat unless as a weapon of last resort. The First Knife, however, is of particular cultural significance and greater offensive use. It is believed to have been crafted by the Votann themselves during the days before the Kin came to the galactic core. Containing a unique power source and worked with script so ancient that no Kin can read it, this blade can be triggered to project a beam of laser energy that scythes through the victim at point-blank range. More than one ambushing foe or doublecrossing faux ambassador has discovered, to their cost, just how deadly The First Knife can be.|

This Relic replaces a forgewrought plasma axe and has the following profile:||true|LoV|Leagues of Votann|This remarkable axe is said to contain the bound fury of a colossal solar flare, syphoned from amidst the nuclear fury of a raging star and trammelled within knotwerk energy fields. Whether this is some boast of the Brôkhyr, or how such immense energies could be contained and channelled, is unclear, but the puissant fury of Flâyre cannot be denied. The axes plasma blade burns so bright that it is painful to look upon as it streaks through the air. It is as swift and deadly as an unleashed star-storm, and leaves nought but charred enemy corpses in its wielder’s wake.|

It fell to the venerated Brôkhyr Ymmâ the Sure to fashion the unique deposit into a RAM shield of unsurpassed resilience and perfect balance. Foes who assail the bearer of Ymmâ’s Shield prove themselves doubly foolish; not only are their efforts futile against the unbreakable bulwark of the shield itself, but striking this beloved relic in anger is a mortal insult to the entire Kin species.

In the centuries since her passing, this rapier-thin blade has passed from officer to officer. Those with the daring to use its strange power are able to cut a ragged hole in reality, somehow opening up a shimmering passageway to a strategic location held in the wielder’s mind.
